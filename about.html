            <p>BROCKHAMPTON is possibly the best boy band since One Direction.
                With 6 albums released in the last 5 years, it is unlikey to not
                have heard at least one of their hits, such as BLEACH, FACE, GINGER,
                GUMMY, BOY BYE, etc. They are one of my personal favorite bands, and I
                have my own ranking of each of their songs you can visit too. Did you
                know that they met on a Kanye West forum? Yes, so did everyone that knows
                who they are. Some reason that fact appears to be the number one things
                people like to bring up when talking about them.
